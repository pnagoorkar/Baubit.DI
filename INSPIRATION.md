# Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from the following open-source libraries:

## [Autofac](https://github.com/autofac/Autofac)

A powerful and flexible Inversion of Control (IoC) container for .NET. Autofac's elegant module-based architecture inspired the modular loading system implemented in this project.

## [Autofac.Configuration](https://github.com/autofac/Autofac.Configuration)

The approach to JSON-based component registration in `Autofac.Configuration` influenced the design of configuration-driven module registration and initialization in this project.

Many thanks to the contributors of these libraries for creating such thoughtful and well-documented tools. Their ideas helped shape the foundational patterns used here.
